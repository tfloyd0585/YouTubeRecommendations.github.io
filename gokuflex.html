<p>The third person that I have to introduce is Gokuflex, a fitness vlogger and challenge taker with 830,000 subscribers.</p>

<p>The majority of his content is dedicated to fitness transformations with friends and clients along with workout tips and advice.</p>

<p>On top of that, he also uploads vlogs documenting life with Sandra (his girlfriend) and various anime related challenges that he does with Sandra and other friends of his.</p>
